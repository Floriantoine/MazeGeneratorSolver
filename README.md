# MazeGeneratorSolver
## Maze Generator and Solver in C/C++ (displayed with ncurses or SFML).

- Developed as part of a first-year project at Epitech, originally in C with a bonus visualization using ncurses.
- Later rewritten in C++ with SFML during the second year to improve C++ skills and add graphical visualization.

### Ncurses version
- Source: `ncurses/`
- Documentation: see `ncurses/README.md` for build/run instructions and the list of ncurses features (step mode, state panel, history/rewind, etc.).

**Mandatory:**  
- [ ] SFML
- [ ] NCURSES

In collaboration with:
 - Simon Houliat (https://github.com/Cpasmopi) -> Creation of the Maze solver
